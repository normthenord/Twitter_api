@thehowie For sure. I think we're going to have localized outbreaks for a long time to come, especially in communities where not enough people got vaccinated for whatever reason. We need to be as comprehensive as possible.
-----------------------
This is not an argument for letting one's guard down. On the contrary, that we might be able to achieve normality a bit sooner via vaccines is an argument for being more careful now. The more people can become immune by getting vaccinated rather than by getting sick, the better.
-----------------------
What percentage? There's some uncertainty there and estimates vary.

@youyanggu estimates that 10-25% of Americans had gotten COVID as of late November:

https://t.co/Qxu8rSPoV1

Scott Gottlieb thinks it could be as much as 30% by year-end.

https://t.co/DrLHqFPKc6
-----------------------
Discussions of how many people need to be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity often omit that the pandemic has been really awful in the US and it's not a pleasant thing to discuss, but a decent minority of the population has naturally-acquired immunity.

@mattyglesias It's very rare that someone is interested in a constructive conversation once they've played the credentialism card. (Especially given that, in theory, a journalist who has spent many years writing about public policy should indeed have some domain knowledge here.)

Instead, especially in that New Hampshire/Nevada period where Sanders seemed to be on a really good trajectory, he was thumbing his nose at the establishment rather than building bridges. Here's some reporting I did at the time.

https://t.co/Ru5vZGhlLy https://t.co/zds97z5CDy
-----------------------
There are ... a lot ... of issues with this story ... but one thing it gets completely wrong is the notion that Sanders was trying to appease the Democratic establishment more so than in 2016. He was pointedly not doing that.

p.s. I'm not advocating for any particular "side" in the lockdown debate, though I think a short-term, circuit-breaker lockdown right now would be highly worthwhile.

But as someone who lives here, NYC/NYS have taken a fairly moderate, pragmatic approach as compared with say CA.
-----------------------
1) FL's true number of infections is likely ~50% higher than NY right now once you adjust for the amount of testing: https://t.co/Qxu8rSPoV1

2) NY is not mostly closed. Schools (re)open, gyms open, indoor dining at 25-50% capacity (+ creative interpretations of "outdoor" dining) https://t.co/vopRZiip0K
-----------------------
@briankoppelman The thing people don't account for enough is the rate of COVID spread in their area. Indoor tennis with one person is gonna be relatively dangerous in North Dakota, but relatively safe in NYC (for now, but monitor as caseloads rise).

It's true that for issue polls, you don't have to model turnout, which is one fewer complication. 

But :
1—It's not clear turnout modeling is a big source of recent poll error
2—Issue polls have challenges election polls *don't* have, e.g. question wording is much more important
-----------------------
Yeah, it's the pollsters who do election polls who put their necks on the line. So I have little patience for polling firms that *don't* do election polling saying that somehow the problems that affect election polling don't affect their polls. https://t.co/xURP787PA3
-----------------------
@DKThomp There's also an argument (I'm not 100% sure I buy it) that shorter polls that focus on horse-race questions are going to have fewer problems with low-trust voters than longer ones that ask dozens of questions.
-----------------------
I don't think polling is broken.

But I also don't buy this *at all*. If election polling isn't accurate, there's no reason to think public opinion/issue polling is any better. At least with election polling you have a way to validate the results.

Agree and have been saying as much

By end of January, 50M Americans might be vaccinated

Population immunity should be over 30% (vax + infxn)

That'll start to slow down the spread

By end of Feb, should be at 40%+ population immunity

By end of March 50%

That will help a lot! https://t.co/F8pT5Zc9ea

Looks like we're again starting to see a big rich-poor gap in COVID spread in New York City.

Wealthy parts of Manhattan and Brooklyn have fairly low positivity rates. Other parts of the city are struggling more.

-----------------------
@aaronecarroll Yeah.... I think in a perfectly rational world, people with a previous infection (especially a relatively recent previous infection) would be lower in the queue.

But also worry if you create too many layers/rules/exceptions, you could also wind up with less efficiency overall.
-----------------------
I was wondering this too, and saw in the NYT today that it was suggested people who had already had COVID might not get early access. But haven't seen it discussed elsewhere and imagine it could become a thorny issue.

https://t.co/Eqig4BhOgP https://t.co/5HpPWlD4Ce https://t.co/KNApzP0rqt
-----------------------
I think people, if anything, *aren't optimistic enough* about how quickly vaccines could improve things by early-mid spring—although that's probably an argument for maintaining more restrictions for the time being.

@BenjySarlin @SeanTrende @ReubenR80027912 Also once we've vaccinated older and vulnerable people, death totals should fall a LOT even if there is still some spread.

@joshtpm There's a lot of stuff though that is probably narrowly rational but may not be collectively so because of the risk of community transmission.
-----------------------
Really bad. California has had the strictest regulations throughout the lockdown, often keeping schools and outdoor stuff closed in a way that hasn't been particularly science-driven, and they've been undermined by Newsom and now Breed in a public, ostentatious way. https://t.co/4wdcqpPXZk

-----------------------
So if you're interested in big round milestones, my guess is there's probably just enough out there for Biden to get to &gt;7.0 million and &gt;4.5% (meaning his lead rounds up to 5 points rather than 4) but we'll see.
-----------------------
I'm not sure quite what's left to count that Wasserman doesn't have yet. Much of the Westchester absentees, I believe, which should be quite blue. Maybe some provisionals in NY State, which can take a long while to count? And various bits and pieces elsewhere (IL, for instance?).

@katienolan @williamfleitch @Medium Katie,

You certainly have my empathy and appreciation. It's clear there's a wide spectrum of behaviors both IRL and on Twitter. I think the centers of the spectrums are a bit different. But I wished people talked about all of this more, including coping strategies.
-----------------------
@williamfleitch @Medium Appreciated this, Will. It feels a lot more like the conversations I'm having with my IRL friends, where nobody's partying like it's 2019, but it's also not going to be healthy to just sit at home for a year, so everybody's always making these complicated calculations about risk.
-----------------------
More data on this from Google. A modest increase in visits to residences over the Thanksgiving holiday, but a big decline in visits to workplaces.

There are some blind spots on this platform because most journalists/elites can work from home whereas most regular people can't. https://t.co/YY13XzAQgq
-----------------------
Also data here on how many people saw people at their households/had people over in the past 7 days. A slight increase (to ~45%) over the past week vs. a week ago, but 45% is fairly typical over the long run. Also a slight decline in gathering at bars. https://t.co/BT47Wv58QC https://t.co/JHm6YWeTMN
-----------------------
@thehowie Yeah, the travel (although that *should* show up in the mobility data?) and the intergenerational mixing would seem like reasons for concern. In the other direction, I suspect some people who ordinarily are seeing people outside their household were being more careful than usual.
-----------------------
Why?

* Some people stayed home.
* Some businesses that are normally open were closed for the holiday.
* Many people see friends and family anyway during a typical week—so a Thanksgiving where some people see friends/family and some don't is not so different than the baseline.
-----------------------
Everybody is understandably concerned about COVID spikes caused by Thanksgiving but if you look at mobility data, there was really no increase vs. previous weeks; arguably a decrease depending on how you squint at the data, in fact. https://t.co/m1gOxoNtX2 https://t.co/OfC0D1YPXb
-----------------------
@CT_Bergstrom Like, I took some phone photos during a blackout in NYC last year where the colors were surreal and alien (not in an especially pretty way, either) and didn't at all resemble what you saw with the naked eye. It clearly didn't seem to know what to do under those conditions.
-----------------------
@CT_Bergstrom My lay understanding: I don't know about proper digital cameras, but I think a lot of phone cameras have algorithms that are designed to really draw out color to produce Instagram-worthy pictures, and they can go sort of haywire in low or unusual light.
-----------------------
@conorsen I'd think some will but that's just a lot dicier. Maybe they should play games outdoors. Nets and Knicks can play at Arthur Ashe Stadium.
-----------------------
@conorsen So the context would be: the numbers are likely improving, a significant portion of the high-risk population has been vaccinated, and people are tired of restrictions after a rough winter. I think it may be hard to sustain momentum to keep stuff closed, especially outdoor stuff.
-----------------------
@conorsen By April you may not have a ton of vaccines ready for the general population, but it's not crazy to think ~20% of the population will have been vaccinated, plus perhaps a roughly equal fraction will have antibodies from a COVID case. That + spring weather could curb spread a lot.
-----------------------
@conorsen Well, this might spoil the survey, but I think people are maybe missing low here. ~Half of NFL teams allow fans—through a very bad phase of the pandemic—although they're a bit more concentrated in red states than baseball teams and some of those are &lt;20% capacity.
-----------------------
Not really a question about baseball but about the pandemic; I'm just curious about what people's expectations are for what the spring will look like.

How many MLB teams will allow fans in their stadiums at at least 20% capacity on Opening Day (~April 1)?
-----------------------
Some states/countries were better than others, but in general the quality of COVID data in the winter and spring was very poor. Even now, there's a lot of ambiguity because many (probably still most) infections are never confirmed with a positive test.
-----------------------
A lot of this is underwhelming—3,456 vs. 2,986 isn't "the starkest [of] discrepancies"—and seems to fall into the category of things that many countries (not just China) were doing, especially early in the pandemic.

Important to note though that "the suburbs put Biden over the top" isn't the same as saying "college-educated white voters put Biden over the top". A lot of the key suburban counties are pretty racially mixed. Not in Wisconsin I guess but certainly in Georgia, for instance.

This is just plain as day. The suburbs, especially high-education suburbs, are where Biden really outperformed Clinton, in a way that was likely pretty decisive in the Electoral College. https://t.co/7SqtX2ACz7

@zeynep @TheStalwart @felixsalmon @MikeIsaac @pt Yeah, agree 100%.
-----------------------
@felixsalmon @TheStalwart @zeynep @MikeIsaac @pt No, I surely wouldn't. I wouldn't really give a shit because I don't think it's ethically problematic and it would probably wind up increasing traffic, etc to the story if we played our cards right.
-----------------------
@TheStalwart @felixsalmon @zeynep @MikeIsaac @pt Yeah I think this theory is pretty bizarre. Unless there's an explicit agreement to the contrary I think the subject of a story has every right in the world to preemptively react to the story.

@conorsen Lotta people clinging to bad takes from when it seemed like the pandemic was primarily an urban/high-density thing.

@MattGlassman312 Lots of parallels to other COVID related stuff, where opinion is highly polarized between American liberals and conservatives on questions that are often 1) very challenging and 2) don't neatly line up with American liberalism or conservatism in any obvious philosophical way.

Political betting markets still give Trump a &gt;10% chance, both nationally and in several states where *results have been certified*.

Although, I think there are some arguments to be had about whether Trump actually gives a crap about Republicans winning in Georgia, or even wants them to win at all. Maybe if they lose he thinks it'll prove how important it is for Republicans to have him on the ballot.
-----------------------
Not that it's likely to swing that many votes, but in theory you'd think Trump would want to wait until after the Georgia runoffs to start the PardonFest.

Another way to look at this data: Tennessee is the 16th most populous state. So the 15 largest states in the US are either blue or purple.

-----------------------
The point is not necessarily that the theory is wrong, but that the idea that some types of people are less likely to answer polls—or to answer them honestly—isn't new, exactly. It's one of the eternal, fundamental challenges of polling.

The "shy Trump voter" theory ... used to explain why Republicans weren't answering exit polls in 2004. https://t.co/IqALG3SyFi
-----------------------
@mattyglesias So the point is not necessarily that there aren't better strategies than Trumpism, but that it's hard for a Republican to point toward any recent counterexamples and convince people that it will work, in a way that Democrats largely can do for Obamaism.
-----------------------
@mattyglesias Of course, you could interpret 2018 differently. Maybe it was mostly a backlash to attempts to repeal Obamacare. GOP turnout was quite high for a midterm, though so was Democratic turnout. They did save the Senate (and indeed gained seats).
-----------------------
@mattyglesias I think the problem is that we don't have a lot of examples of either way of how effective the first strategy is, electorally. The 2018 midterms featured a fair amount of "cultural" issues (i.e. the caravan) but Trump wasn't on the ballot and it didn't go well for the GOP.
-----------------------
@DKThomp Trumpism-has-a-high-floor is a part of the story for sure. If you overperform in white rural states, you're going to hold the Senate a large majority of the time, even if you usually lose the presidency and are up-and-down in the House.
-----------------------
@jbarro That's plausible for sure. Although if true in some ways a bearish read for the GOP in the short term, since in 2022 they'll probably still be seen as the party of Trump (largely unpopular with swing voters) without having the turnout boost that Trump provides.
-----------------------
The GOP has lost a lot of elections, after all: before Trump this year, Romney, McCain, Dole, Bush 41. Bush 43 won twice, but was unpopular enough by the end (resulting in bad GOP years in 2006 and 2008) that it probably isn't easy to sell as having been electorally successful.
-----------------------
It's the "mediocre at best" part that people will take to be provocative, I suppose. But it's the "not clear that the GOP's alternatives are better" part that may be more interesting: both the perception of it (does the GOP view moderation as a losing strategy?) and the reality.
-----------------------
Thesis that might be worth exploring:

Trumpism isn't a terribly effective electoral strategy—its track record is mediocre at best, even considering how much overperforming with noncollege whites helps with the Senate etc—but it's not clear that the GOP's alternatives are better.
-----------------------
This is a good read. Small household gatherings have always been a potential source of spread, but they haven't been a point of emphasis until recently. "Wait, now you can't even go over to friends/family's houses?" may be a hard message to sell vs. focusing on risk-reduction. https://t.co/9HWCqyVw1S
-----------------------
@BenjySarlin @chrislhayes Really? More than you expected from Loeffler, who embraced the endorsement of a QAnon promoter?
-----------------------
@BenjySarlin @chrislhayes 1) I don't know how far it got. Not only did they not breach the castle, I'm not sure they breached the moat.

2) This is debatable, obviously, but the fact that it was transparently ludicrous/doomed to fail could have been one reason that it didn't get more pushback.
-----------------------
@chrislhayes Obviously theories centered around GOP officials/functionaries were on much warmer ground than ones centered around the courts. If someone had one of those theories, congrats to them. If they had a court-driven theory, they probably need to re-evaluate their assumptions.
-----------------------
@chrislhayes OK, but "sure this could happen ... if the race is REALLY close" was always my position but got me yelled at by a bunch of people who thought that wasn't alarmist enough.
-----------------------
Trump has also gotten his ass handed to him in court decisions so far. So if your version of the story was "courts will steal the election for Trump", I think that requires a deeper re-examination of one's priors than other theories.
-----------------------
This is still the Underwear Gnomes problem. Under what pretext would ACB "thrown out ballots", enough to swing a not-super-duper-close election? To the extent we're talking about mail votes that arrived after Election Day, the impact of that is quite small FWIW. https://t.co/hZc9uzxj8q
-----------------------
Which was always an implausible plan that was extremely unlikely to succeed. To the extent that's the scenario people were banking on, it does look like an overreaction. There was never any explanation of the doctrine or pretext that courts would use to stop the count. https://t.co/1siCjfM19Z
-----------------------
Maybe that's OK. "We don't know *how* the election might be stolen, but Trump has expressed a lot of dangerous ideas and parts of the system haven't been tested, so we need to keep our guard up". That's totally reasonable. But there's a fine line between vigilance and panic.
-----------------------
Namely, there was a lack of precision to many of them; they didn't explain the mechanisms by which the election would be stolen. Often they were a bit Underwear Gnomes-ish:

1. Trump wants to steal the election
2. ???*
3. ELECTION STOLEN

* Or "THE COURTS!!"
-----------------------
It didn't come close to succeeding. But I don't think people should inherently be criticized for having pointed out that a high-impact but low-probability event—Trump stealing the election—deserved attention.

...

With that said, there were issues with *some* of these claims.

There's also a degree of path-dependance. If Facebook has lost high-info readers because its news feed is too low-quality, the remaining customers might not like it if you changed things. But ideally you'd want to win the high-info readers back, which could take time to measure.
-----------------------
Publishers understand this, which is why they employ editors. If the NYT wanted to maximize traffic *next week*, they could publish lots of highly sensationalist or even conspiratorial stories about Trump, etc. But this would likely be very damaging to them in the long term.
-----------------------
One thing that's striking here is the extent to which Facebook is maximizing for short-term, measurable gains as opposed to long-term brand equity. A better news feed could result in more trust from readers, more partnerships with news organizations, higher internal morale, etc. https://t.co/4ettG93YVw

@BenjySarlin There's also an argument that outdoor things should have been more open in the summer so people could prepare themselves for having potentially much less social activity in the winter. Certainly less beach-shaming, etc.
-----------------------
@BenjySarlin I don't know. Europe has had very big problems in the fall too, obviously, despite better messaging and more stimulus. I don't think people widely understood that the warm-weather equilibrium of social activity wouldn't keep R&lt;=1 in colder water.
-----------------------
…when being aware of those effects might have helped us to better prepare for the fall/winter surge in a variety of ways.
-----------------------
This from @zeynep is good on some of the messaging challenges around COVID. Everyone was so concerned with trying to debunk the notion that COVID would just "go away" in warmer weather that they downplayed evidence of reasonably strong seasonal effects…https://t.co/lRntupFyBh
-----------------------
TBH it's kind of astonishing you think that I (an econ grad, btw) wouldn't know that. And part of an annoying pattern of academics underestimating the knowledge of non-academics. Matt brought it up recently in the context of COVID and I thought it was appropriate to refer to him. https://t.co/78aCwnWKbl
-----------------------
@zeynep @davidshor @MattZeitlin @mattyglesias I mean it was certainly a weird column. The first half about the bubble was useful. And the second half about his decision to see his family while taking a *lot* of precautions is defensible. When you fuse those together into one column though it sets a strange tone.
-----------------------
@zeynep @davidshor @MattZeitlin @mattyglesias I think people understand pretty well their social bubbles are not pristine. It's mostly a euphemism to say "everybody's being *pretty* careful here, right?". Or it's hygenie theater to defend the choice to see other people in person when you think you might get scolded for it.
-----------------------
FWIW my point here is not to make people feel particularly comfortable about the situation in NYC. The positive test rate has been (slowly) rising and my guess is it will rise further. But this shows the arbitrariness of the 3% threshold.
-----------------------
Looks like NYC's 7-day average positivity rate dipped -- by the slimmest possible margin -- under 3% again. (3% was the threshold for closing schools. I don't know what the protocol is for reopening them.)

The persistent idea that Republicans doubled down on Trump populism is not correct. The top issues in final ads were taxes, economy, &amp; health care. Trade &amp; immigration were less emphasized. Rep House margins outperformed Trump &amp; Reps continued using lots of conservative rhetoric.

-----------------------
@davidshor @MattZeitlin @mattyglesias Also matters that transmission is relatively low in northern CA right now. Anyway, it shows how disconnected the Twitter bubble is from reality. I'm pretty sure that nearly all of my (mostly liberal, well-informed) IRL friends would consider that adequately cautious.
-----------------------
@MattZeitlin This is piggybacking off a @mattyglesias point but I think it shows the problem is that a lot of COVID behavior which may be rational from an individual's standpoint can nonetheless cause negative externalities for society.
-----------------------
@Neoavatara I'm not sure I'd take at face value the White House's claim that it was testing frequently.
-----------------------
Fauci is also a fan of frequent testing, at least as a theoretical concept. Tests need to be faster, more accurate &amp; more available. But the view that "tests just give people a false sense of security" has gone too far. They're a big part of the solution.

https://t.co/zOjT5jXjUy https://t.co/jPjiedbue5
-----------------------
FWIW, New York City health officials have been encouraging people to get tested once a month or so as a surveillance measure. I agree that it may be a bad idea to do so *right now* if there's a rush in advance of Thanksgiving. But NYC has pretty decent testing capacity. https://t.co/DI7BaAnbt4 https://t.co/SDqOg7SzBc

@seeglazek @jbarro I'm optimistic that things will be normal-ish by mid-2021. I think it might take a bit longer before people are comfortable planning things for larger rather than smaller, more tightly-knit groups.
-----------------------
@benyt 1) They're not particularly liquid; 2) I can't bet since it would get me in deep trouble with my employer and is also a bit ethically dubious since our analysis can move markets. But I hope some of my followers are making a little extra spending money.
-----------------------
Yes, Trump can request a 2nd recount, but there was already one recount, and recounts don't overturn 10K+ vote margins.
-----------------------
Georgia *just certified its result for Biden* but prediction markets still give Trump a 9% chance of winning there. Lot of dumb money out there, and I mean that quite literally. https://t.co/qpmkmQfImF https://t.co/tBAwZ2U4SR

Georgia @GovKemp just certified the state’s 16 Democratic presidential electors, saying he was legally bound to make the decision — and that it “paves the way for the Trump campaign to pursue other legal options and a separate recount if they choose.” #gapol https://t.co/UIwuCv1Lu7

-----------------------
@NateDuncanNBA Yeah I'd hope that like "let's pay teachers way more" would be one of the legacies of this pandemic. Unfortunately, I think it might be the opposite with school budgets really suffering.
-----------------------
@jbarro Yeah, I think there's going to be a lot of overcompensation (not necessarily a bad thing). Plus stuff like people having a big 41st birthday party because their 40th fell during the pandemic.
-----------------------
I'm not sure that remote *learning* is going to have its reputation enhanced by this, though—probably the opposite. 

More voting by mail? I originally thought that would outlast the pandemic, but the way Trump/Republicans politicized it in the US, I don't know about that now.
-----------------------
I'm sure there will be some changes, but it seems like stuff that was overdue anyway. To take a trivial example, fast-food restaurants were always a natural fit for delivery and it's not surprising they upped their game. Less trivially, probably more tolerance for remote work.
-----------------------
Predictable, but many of these techno-utopian takes from early in the pandemic seem like they'll age poorly by having underestimated people's desire for in-person human contact. That's been hard to turn off, in ways that's made it hard to stop the spread. https://t.co/3dMqKe55I7 https://t.co/mWeXe3wcje
-----------------------
There *were* some white-working areas that shifted toward Biden. Northern New England is another good example. But others shifted toward Trump. A bit of a confusing map. https://t.co/UzJcFEDSkf
-----------------------
Yeah. I think it's well and good to try to persuade people to curtail their social activity. The equation has changed, with cases rising and vaccines on the way.

But you're probably not going to be very persuasive if you treat people's desire to see family/friends as frivolous. https://t.co/7O7qPkwpzF
-----------------------
I get annoyed by the "pay people to stay home" message too, because it conflates two issues, one concerning the continuity of businesses and one concerning people's personal behavior. Better would be something like:

"Pay businesses to stay closed. Encourage people to stay home." https://t.co/UgKFqkQevy
-----------------------
@DanFosterType This is kind of a dumb troll. It's good to have probabilities when there is uncertainty. There isn't any uncertainty about who won the election.
-----------------------
I don't think Republicans going 80% of the way toward acknowledging Biden won is necessarily much better than not acknowledging it at all. What's needed is clarity, moral and otherwise, not ambiguity. https://t.co/ppDMOWryDm

@TheStalwart @tylercowen @RobTerrin @AnnieDuke @milouness @ByrneHobart @seanlippel @mattyglesias @bobgourley @PTetlock I'd be first in line.
-----------------------
@MattGlassman312 Part of what I think makes it less complicated too is that this *precise* group of 4 senators have a lot of electoral immunity, to coin an expression. Murkowski's incentives changed a lot with the top 4 system that AK adopted. The other three possibly on their last term.
-----------------------
@MattGlassman312 l mean in some ways it might make sense for a Romney + Murkowksi + Collins + Manchin group to form *now*, because that way they have de facto control of the Senate regardless of who wins the Georgia runoffs.
-----------------------
I don't *quite* get Democrats' cynicism on Romney, Collins and Murkowski. They're Republicans! They're often going to vote for conservative stuff! But Murk/Collins voted with Trump only ~1/2 the time in the last Congress. And Romney voted to impeach Trump! https://t.co/hdJRgWVME7 https://t.co/qQVJCQqcUi
-----------------------
@AJentleson Right, yeah.
-----------------------
That doesn't mean he'd ever in a million years vote with the Democrats on, say, taxes. But on basic good-governance stuff—letting Biden appoint a cabinet, protecting against future elections from being stolen—he would.
-----------------------
Perhaps a bit far-fetched, but Romney actually has a decent amount of leverage, if he and one of Collins, Murkowski, etc. threatened to become "Independent Republicans" or what have you who caucused with the Democrats.
-----------------------
@Yair_Rosenberg And I think you're right that people sort of perpetuated some overly optimistic signals of what could be accomplished with a 4-8 week lockdown.
-----------------------
@Yair_Rosenberg Yeah. I mean, it was hard to be certain I guess—China seemed to do an OK job of containing it, and maybe it would prove to be super seasonal or something—but if you looked at the history of respiratory pandemics, "this is going to last a year+" was a reasonable expectation.
-----------------------
I was fairly pessimistic about COVID early on, but there was kind of this naiveté that I think I (and other people) had about timing. Like no one wanted to say "this could disrupt life for a year or longer" so anyone who said some version of that caught my attention.
-----------------------
I'm not sure if I can find the exact quotes, but I can remember @sciencecohen and @HelenBranswell saying things to the effect of "this is going to be with us for a long time" and that really sticking with me. https://t.co/azbjU1hea2

-----------------------
@MileHighBrendan @chrislhayes Trump underperformed the fundamentals by 4-5 points, according to our analysis. And I think it's telling that Congressional Republicans, who had more distance from the anti-democratic tactics, outperformed Trump.
-----------------------
@chrislhayes It's not clear that it's 40-45% though. More like 50+% of Republicans but 25-30% of the overall electorate. And I'd argue that's a pretty relevant difference. https://t.co/IsVz4l88jp
-----------------------
@chrislhayes That seems to be the conventional wisdom, but I see no particular evidence behind it. I can imagine swing voters not liking this very much. I can also imagine it depressing GOP turnout. Or maybe not. But I think people are too quick to attribute strategic goals to it.
-----------------------
2020-11-19 17:30:19
Trump is very savvy at constantly forcing fellow Republicans to choose between 1. doing his bidding and therefore remaining a Republican-in-good-standing in GOP circles or 2. acting according to normal democratic values, but losing Republican-in-good-standing status.
ID: 1329477116254183424
-----------------------
Revisiting this:

It's not as though Trumpism has been a particularly successful electoral strategy. But there's a degree of path-dependancy. If Republicans can win elections about half the time with it because of their structural advantages, they have less incentive to change. https://t.co/KupMfju2F0
-----------------------
I think these elites are also deluding themselves if they think that, if an election eventually does get stolen (very very likely not this one, but say 2024/2028/etc) that they'll be able to go back to the sort of cushy public life that they once enjoyed. It would be total chaos. https://t.co/RJoRxPaGdq
-----------------------
2) People need to get over their obsession with internal polls. They usually say the same thing as high-quality public polls. They usually don't tell you anything you don't know. To the extent they do, it may be a) spin or b) wrong.

https://t.co/tyIZ8cJb5p
-----------------------
Agree with this, and two additional points of context:

1) There's always the tendency to cast winning campaigns in the best possible light (and vice versa). FWIW, I do think Biden ran one of the better campaigns we've seen recently. But still, be wary of this halo effect. https://t.co/ZH9JFHpynr
-----------------------
@kmedved @MattZeitlin I think this dynamic was especially bad for COVID because coming up with a cohesive strategy sustainable over 12-18 months was always going to be incredibly difficult, so it was easier to just point toward Trump's (indeed mostly terrible/incoherent) approach and say "not that".
-----------------------
Basically it says Trump was wrong about lots of stuff and didn't actually make it any easier to open up schools, but nonetheless Trump's expressed support for school-openings made Democrats instinctively line up on the other side. That seems largely correct to me. https://t.co/TuafxAVML1
-----------------------
People are slamming this column based on the headline but the article itself isn't nearly as trollish as the headline makes it out to be and it seems like a lot of people aren't actually reading it.

It's hard to strike the right balance between, on the one hand, pointing out how the erosion of democratic norms around accepting election results is highly concerning in the long run, and, on the other hand, pointing out how desperate and pathetic this all is.
-----------------------
Was projected to go higher so something good seemingly happened to the Knicks for a change but look forward to discovering how it turns out badly in the end. https://t.co/8YLEehBaRS
-----------------------
Also, I hate to touch off the "where is the herd immunity threshold?" debate but one datapoint worth mentioning here is that he estimates ND and SD have 35-40% of their populations infected and cases are still rising, though more slowly than before.
-----------------------
Really glad this is relaunching. And I like the emphasis on "nowcasting" rather than forecasting. It's been very hard to get reliable estimates of how many people truly have COVID at any given time (since not all cases are detected) and this is a big step forward. https://t.co/VzMy2ylMi5
-----------------------
@chrislhayes @LPDonovan Tossup based on how many ballots are left outstanding in NY, which nobody seems entirely sure of
-----------------------
I have receipts on what you did share and they did not match the 538 averages. https://t.co/ZJ0fqECum1
-----------------------
Also, the state's data still has 7-day average positivity in NYC at under 3% (more specifically, 2.5%). https://t.co/ajrjsiKyMv https://t.co/c5mLI28fke
-----------------------
Not looking to start an argument here, but at least in late October, Biden's internal polling—at least what they were sharing with reporters—was in fact very similar to the public polling.

https://t.co/5D8rO8W6ka https://t.co/6f4I4JLUkF
-----------------------
@bruce_arthur No but the increase is pretty modest. It's been at 2.5%ish for a while, slowly ticking upward.
-----------------------
@bruce_arthur You just can't learn that much from the positivity rate alone, though. If you have a positivity rate of 3% and it was 0.3% a week ago, that indicates exponential growth. If it was 3% and it was 6% a week ago, that indicates decline.
-----------------------
@bruce_arthur I don't buy either that a consensus of epidemiologists are saying that, or that it's robust analysis if they are. There are no magic inflection points here. And you'd measure growth by Rt, not the positivity rate.
-----------------------
It's not as though 3% is some tried-and-true, empirically- derived heuristic that's proven robust over many past pandemics. Everybody is just making this shit up as they go along! It's completely arbitrary.
-----------------------
I don't get why NYC feels bound to stick by a 3% positivity rule for closing schools when we know more about the virus now, including relatively low rates of transmission in schools. If I were a parent I'd be furious.

https://t.co/CfZJPDYENy
-----------------------
@kmedved I'm not super sure why expectations matter here but I also think that some of those forecasts misdiagnosed the macro conditions. Defending seats won in a D+9 environment (2018) presented a lot of downside risk for D's in an era of weak incumbency.
-----------------------
@Neoavatara Everyone would take the presidency + the House + maybe the Senate over state legislatures.
-----------------------
"Nobody owns those seats" is *especially* true in an era like now where there's a weak incumbency bonus, and it can make comparing results after a midterm and a presidential year pretty apples-to-oranges. Of note: Democrats gained a lot of seats relative to 2016 in the House.
-----------------------
I don't think "but they lost seats in the House!" is a great take because nobody owns those seats—everybody's term expired—and winning seats as the out-party at a midterm is a whole different (and much easier) ballgame than winning them in a presidential year.
-----------------------
@Neoavatara They won the House and the Senate is TBD.
-----------------------
Feels like everyone's running with their Why-Democrats-Lost takes even though Democrats won.
