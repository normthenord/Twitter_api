Angels only care about what you look like on the inside. A pure heart is the vessel that contains a soul's true beauty.

My family said that it was hard to find stuff of Pure Vessel but they fuckin found some things!! Thinking about taking a picture of my whole Hollow Knight collection since it's taken over my life. Such a good game that I have put 162 hours into as of today. https://t.co/D6bJR1Vn5V

if you know who Pure Vessel is, I bow to you

Christ was a pure vessel born of the void to contain the Infection and save hollownest https://t.co/HKvoW8xap2
-----------------------
the fact that there isnt any pure vessel plush or any pure vessel merch at all is SICKENING. please @ fangamer i‚Äôll show u my feet
-----------------------
The X in "X-man" isn't meant to replace Christ. X is the Greek letter for Chi, but pronounced "Key". Jesus was a vessel with no darkness, meant to battle Vanitas, a being of pure darkness, to create the X-blade, a weapon of ultimate power to open the true Kingdom Hearts. https://t.co/lkAFDbN2ML

Pure Vessel was always my favorite

virgin hollow knight, CHAD PURE VESSEL
-----------------------
@whatisafloppy yeah but in that one both the knight and the hollow knight/pure vessel get no redemption and die
at least the radiance/infection is defeated i guess
-----------------------
@realSabertore Gdi I didn't mean to put that name on twitter 

Ambrosia is what Grimm named the Pure Vessel in a fuckin, grimm X pure vessel fanfic I read, and thought the name was so cute I just started calling them Ambrosia instead of pure vessel
-----------------------
#hollowknight #hollowknightfanart

what if the Pure Vessel was blind?

What if everyone assumed their unresponsiveness when no one was around was because they were hollow, and not because they were simply afraid of running into things?

what if Grimm found out first? https://t.co/hegUQQf5Wa
-----------------------
@AnimeFanTalk More like a pure vessel of hate
-----------------------
@JacksonLanzing @Jody_Houser Only got through the bit where you initially suggested *firing EXEO at the Romulan vessel* and my face was the same as everyone on screen's: shock, bafflement, and pure joyous wonder all rolled into one

@themeatly Pure Vessel from the Hallownest Pantheon. #HollowKnight 
soo happy to play it again on #NintendoSwitch. https://t.co/VuZxLz9496
-----------------------
2 more to go and I tried unlocking the radiant but the pure vessel got me https://t.co/Cn46M98vdC
-----------------------
damn im in the mood for mashin up all 4 vessel themes from hollow knight to make the ultimate vessel theme
sealed vessel + pure vessel + main theme + broken vessel
-----------------------
All right, just beat Pure Vessel twice in a row in practice. This is one of those high, high peaks that only a very difficult but very fair game like Hollow Knight can give you. Little more practice and I think I'm ready to kick some ass officially.
-----------------------
@theCKBuchanan It's an interesting group if you want to dig in a little. Carrie, Norman, and Mrs. V all have sympathetic motives for their twisted actions. Jack Torrance, on the other hand, is pure banality of evil. An empty vessel waiting to be filled by malevolence.
-----------------------
@Darren_Mooney NITPICK: The Immaculate Conception refers to the conception of Mary, who was conceived uniquely un-tainted by Original Sin so as to be a pure vessel to carry the Messiah. Jesus's conception was a *miraculous* one, as, apparently, was Anakin's, having no physical father.

Did you know that sometimes the shade cloak doesn‚Äôt work on pure vessel?
-----------------------
For the love of my boredom to he gone

Someone please make a Pure vessel poseable figure

I'll do everything to buy it

I'd join a chat room for nonwhite trans people but I'm afraid of being driven out cause I post noncon on Twitter and think the Pure Vessel had incestuous feelings for its dad, leading it to be susceptible to moths.
-----------------------
@IAMtheArtofSoul Well that makes more sense now as I hooked into your vibe Youtube....üò≥üòÇü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I would say I think you could focus and change anything you want. What‚Äôs it take?‚Äî Pure focus on the acids or whatever the vessel needs for the task.

My imagination üëäü§óüíö‚òÄÔ∏èLove You and Wow

died to pure vessel lol
-----------------------
When you use your vessel to share Universal light with others, naturally the divine grace your vessel with pure white crystalline light for assisting their work. Co-Creator. You are seen. You are appreciated. You are Universal.

The X in "X-mas" isn't meant to replace Christ. X is the Greek letter for Chi, but pronounced "Key". Jesus was a vessel with no darkness, meant to battle Vanitas, a being of pure darkness, to create the X-blade, a weapon of ultimate power to open the true Kingdom Hearts.

These tainted flames of pure white will be swallowed into his vessel with a single inhale. Almost like a global windstorm met its zenith, the suction of air completely effaced the hexed flames distinguished for their power-manipulating disposition.

I beat Pure Vessel on Radiant difficulty on Hollow Knight today. 99% won‚Äôt understand it but if you do, you know it‚Äôs a bloody big deal. #HollowKnight #PureVessel #1000Deaths
-----------------------
Daaa need a detox ü•¥...I feel like my vessel filled with PURE shit and it‚Äôs lowering my frequency...I‚Äôm trying to VIBE HIGH....
-----------------------
So I beat Pure Vessel on attuned today. Took me awhile to learn the attacks and know what to do. As well as feeling confident with my dodging and not hesitating. Most of the times I got hit were due to hesitation. After I do ascended I‚Äôll be ready for the pantheon!#HollowKnight

@3eyeguy Sorry babe I can‚Äôt use public transportation my parents are trying to keep my holy vessel pure and untarnished
