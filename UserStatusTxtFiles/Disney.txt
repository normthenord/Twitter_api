@disneyplus @MarvelStudios Why does @Disney still advertise on Fox News? 

They prop up right wing media that led to the violent insurrection and attempted massacre at the capitol and is downplaying it RIGHT NOW.

I dunno why, but I guess I already predicted how the movie would play out in the first 15 minutes.  It's not a new formula in the Disney aspect but I definitely agree with your thoughts about this.

@CREWcrew I will not forget. @disney was a top Trump funder. I dumped almost 20K of their stock on Thursday and Friday and canceled my subscription to their channel. I will not fund those who fund a traitor.

Will you guys shut up? I'm talking about Disney finding someone to make their money off of, the way they made billions off of Miley. Of course she'll never be the phenomenon Miley is.

@hollygolightIy I think it's the fact that a lot of people grew up with her on Disney, and she's still playing teenagers in Spider-Man and Euphoria. It's just kind of hard to grasp that she is already 24

@ginacarano 
I may not agree with all of yours feelings or belief's but does that mean I have to be angry and cry to disney to fire you when you like a tweet I don't agree with? NO! I love you for you and the character you bring to Star Wars U GO GIRL!❤️
-----------------------
it’s weird how disney made like, three completely different adaptations of treasure island in different eras and they’re all pretty good

@marinaomi Dad used to let me pick the music when I rode in his car, but I had to pick from *his* albums (so no Raffi, no Disney soundtracks). For some reason I really latched onto Peter Gabriel’s “Us”. When we got to “Steam”, my 4-year-old ass would rock OUT. https://t.co/bEfXu78qtf

I finished watching season 1 of Amphibia and I like it! There was only season 1 on Disney + so I’m gonna watch season 2 somewhere else.
-----------------------
I think Maggie is animated better in the newer (I say newer, like 2009?) one. Obviously Marge is more stilted though

I would like to point out that since around Disney taking over the animation has gotten way more fluid. It's really impressive https://t.co/dao1NOZqfZ

@Ryan_Hecht That’s not the little fella. There are at least 2 regulars in this pint and this is the bigger one. The really little one is in the pond near the 8th tee. As for the name, I decided not to commit to a name considering Disney has an open permit.
-----------------------
Mad how with Prime and Disney+ you don’t need to pay extra for 4K movies and tv shows but with Netflix and Now TV, you’ve gotta fork out more money on your subscription for HD and not even UHD.

-----------------------
So...yeah. That's it. I'm certain most people are aware this is fake, but in case you didn't, now you do. And remember, if there EVER WAS to be word on some new #GravityFalls content, it would come from Alex Hirsch or Disney's OFFICIAL accounts, not some small YouTube channel! https://t.co/2I8fhRcb4D

And forgive me for sounding rude, but I think anyone with a half functioning brain would know this is NOT a description you'd see on an REAL Disney XD video. I'm not gonna dare click those links given it's probably a virus! F in the chat to anyone who did!

@SA2BKeon One of my favorite things about the Disney world in KH3 is how often Disney characters interact with organization 13 it really does help make them fell like they’re all part of the same world and flesh out the characters

This is NOT the OFFICIAL Disney XD channel!

@BoneRangerr @fantasticmstfox Okay. So I know this is ridiculous. But the France bakery at Disney has the best eclairs. So if I can I will mail them. Also I think Publix may have good ones? I’m gonna try theirs. They have good cream puffs and those are hard to do
-----------------------
@SaltyMusicStan I think she just has the kids on her side like the way Hannah Montana did, I didn't even know that girl was getting a Disney cheque

@SnazzyQ Apple TV 4K because it does Dolby Vision and Atmos on most streaming services, I can mirror my Phone and can use Apple Music directly on my Hometheatre system.

Even a G rated Disney Pixar movie has great conflict. They have characters that argue. Or there’s an antagonist with a diabolical plot. I’m shocked that so many writers can just write a screenplay without any conflict.  Literally, zero conflict. https://t.co/bqAUvJrjNs

So #WandaVision comes out on Disney plus next Friday. Do I dare watch it then or wait till March when all the episodes are out? I wish they would just release them all like Netflix does.

@weerulent right it's so weird, taylor is not even an ex disney girlie why do they like her sm??

i have to say something: i used to watch bizaardvark firstyear of highshool twas the last of my disney channel years and i liked olivia more than madison lmao
-----------------------
There is a link to it on Disney+ But it literally looks like this. 
This probably means they could be preparing for it to come on D+ in Norway soon.. I hope it does https://t.co/CrEwZIOegX

Other than that I’ve shopped at Office Depot within the last year. The whole vibe in that store is off. Happy to never go back.
-----------------------
@SirDemiface I don't blame Weadon for the movie since many of the issues likely tie into the MCU itself but it was were you started to see his rep fall, when the drama happened I think Disney realized they didn't really need him and could just slot someone else into the same place.
-----------------------
@bomani_jones Yeah man, them dudes acted like staying at Disney world for 3 months during a pandemic was a damn Mars mission or some shit. They weren’t going to go back to that format

@RichardWPickett @naval @DevinFidler @AriDavidPaul @WholeFoods @Disney Also to zoom in a bit on this Trump banned thing that’s woken up the internet, I really just have one thing to say... propaganda has its consequences.

@HatokTalk I'm pretty sure they like had early drafts for everything before Disney got involved but no one ever mentions that. most of the stories were planned ahead. people just be dogging on shit for no reason at this point
-----------------------
Can't decide if I want the steelbook editions of "Force Awakens", "The Last Jedi" &amp; "The Rise of Skywalker". On one hand I really like the designs but on the other I can watch them on Disney+ any time I want. These would just end up sitting on my shelf. #StarWars

I watched "Soul" last night. I must say, it's not at all what I expected. I purposefully avoided any advance publicity on the film before viewing it. Overall, I liked the film, and I recommend it. Disney and Pixar’s Soul | Official Trailer | Disney+ https://t.co/tEymUMXd6q

-----------------------
@parlertakes are they also planning on canceling their NetFlix, Comcast, Adobe, Disney, etc etc who all use AWS???  They really should
-----------------------
@MichaelAvolio @MovieKessler Well, all of Wes Anderson's movies are in there. And they're all Buena Vista or Searchlight owned, no? Grand Budapest just came out last year after Disney bought Fox. So never say never.
-----------------------
@ByJohnLMicek @AFARmedia Sort of like Disney World.
-----------------------
Do I go to downtown Disney this week or no
-----------------------
(4 cont) I felt like all of this strange gendered stuff could have been avoided by naming the cat Mittens. That's another issue - that the film never explores what it feels like to be a soul in a different body. There's gray area there that perhaps Disney didn't want to explore

-----------------------
@SeanNyberg @sivaebrm Ahh .... No. I was referring to how some comedians won't work blue. As in: Do adult material. Though -- that said -- during their Investor Day presentation, Disney officials did talk up Star. Which will allow subscribers in Europe, Canada &amp; NZ to watch more adult material.

@NnijoryP @fckeveryword IMO, Disney should’ve changed the age in the movie to 18. Also she’s with Aladdin anyways (lucky bastard).

If Disney wants to introduce the X-men into the Marvel universe, they should just start with a Disney+ show about Xavier's School, and have about five seasons of teen angst and mutant adventure, before spinning into big budget movies.
-----------------------
@RichardWPickett @naval @DevinFidler @AriDavidPaul @WholeFoods @Disney Cool. Your choice but to me that seems to be the problem today... the lack of discourse... or withdrawal from it. I may be wrong on my freedom comment but at least I invited you to educate me.

-----------------------
@DavidHoban8 @m_millsey Try going to Disney World and loudly proclaiming the election was stolen. They will throw you out. Sure you say, “that’s not a platform.” True. It’s a private business like social media companies. Read their terms of service. If you don’t like them, do not voluntarily sign up.
-----------------------
disney be like, for Hercules, should we hire some white boy you never heard of or People’s sexiest man alive? 🤔

Y’all who want nicki to recreate her old shit doing exactly what Disney is doing rn and it’s always underwhelming. I want NEW shit and a NEW sound with NEW visuals. Can’t have 2014 in 2021.

Disney has really out done themselves. Between Rise of the Resistance to The Banshee Flight for Avatar, it’s crazy immersive. The socially distanced lines scare people away too. They seem really long. Haven’t waited more than 25 minutes for anything. https://t.co/wCZqNAWEgJ
-----------------------
@WhoaFX @IndependantIowa @themandalorian @ginacarano @Disney It's okay when they do it " race riots over the last two years" not okay when anyone else does " yet only a small splinter group involved in actual crimes and very few people harmed or killed ". Then they go after the police for not using enough force or violence lol

Next film for the #ClosedCinemaMovieClub is going to be possibly the first film that was affected by the pandemic way back when... Mulan

Will you be watching this week?
It's available on Disney +
-----------------------
@gaganaym I only knew because I saw the VHS tapes when I was 5.
But Disney does tend to release few sequels to many of their classic movies that don't always capture the same "magic" nor gather as much attention.
Worth having a look at any animated classics you liked, might have sequels.

@culofever I also get the expense must’ve been insane and who knows if Disney would’ve done that again. 

But I mean more along the lines of they aren’t stopping games. That to me is a bad bad look

@marcorubio So, if someone broke into your house, stole your jewelry, used your credit card to run up $10,000 at Disney World, shat on your living room rug and tracked it into the bedrooms,

@justinkan Idk, when it only took the great Hari a few generations I recognized our world for what it is. Disney, Exxon, Lockheed and others took us far enough; what is this but another line to cross?

@Disney You must stop sponsoring Fox News. It spreads disinformation and is largely responsible for the domestic terrorism that took place Jan. 6th. #FoxNewsIsComplicit

@DisneyPlusHelp @bearahcate Wow as if the weekenders still isn’t ok Disney plus, almost 14 months later. Mandalorian is over so I’ll be cancelling my sub  (after I watch the last episode one last time) 🤷‍♂️
-----------------------
Just found eragon on disney+, really wish I knew where my inheritance books were! It would also be great if they made a TV show of all 4 books!
-----------------------
@sivaebrm My understanding is that Disney+ is basically following the old what-a-bride-does-for-good-luck-on-her-wedding-day adage (i.e., "Something old, something new ..") as it makes out the future schedule of its subscription streaming service. Please disregard the "something blue" part
-----------------------
@CultureCrave Disney's saving grace for the Star Wars franchise that they almost blew! Take notes and don't make any more movies until you figure out how to not screw it up anymore!

@georgendebele22 I meant that I’m watching it right when it comes out on Disney+

@KehlanisMaid @RapAlert1 she’s from disney and swifties like her and yk how YT privellege is always beneficial so that ties into it all
-----------------------
@miraicoder Is it at Disney world?
-----------------------
don’t read the dumb take about movie genres. There are only two movie genres of consequence:

1. People sitting around drinking coffee

2. Disney
-----------------------
@tayIorsIover that’s a fair assumption considering her time on disney channel but i think y’all are forgetting how much easier it is for music to go viral than it was even 3 years ago. tiktok has changed the game so much. i betlike half of the streams are from tiktok alone. the songs good so

idk why this happens, i dont think i pay for this a part of my disney + but for the past 3 weeks, george lucas has called me in the middle of the night to try &amp; convince me "Mandatorian" is a good pun. Like it could be it own thing. He wants to start an etsy and make merch?

@opps_umhi how would i know of a girl who played in disney shoes from those years😭 none of them are relevant to us
-----------------------
@marnanel oh! and related, when i hear that someone grew up in Florida in the 80s/90s but never went to Disney, i have a similar sense of recalibration. of *course* that's a thing, but it's just exceptionally common, even at lower income levels, because of school trips or generous friends
