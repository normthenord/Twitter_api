@katienolan @williamfleitch @Medium Katie,

You certainly have my empathy and appreciation. It's clear there's a wide spectrum of behaviors both IRL and on Twitter. I think the centers of the spectrums are a bit different. But I wished people talked about all of this more, including coping strategies.
-----------------------
@williamfleitch @Medium Appreciated this, Will. It feels a lot more like the conversations I'm having with my IRL friends, where nobody's partying like it's 2019, but it's also not going to be healthy to just sit at home for a year, so everybody's always making these complicated calculations about risk.

More data on this from Google. A modest increase in visits to residences over the Thanksgiving holiday, but a big decline in visits to workplaces.

There are some blind spots on this platform because most journalists/elites can work from home whereas most regular people can't. https://t.co/YY13XzAQgq
-----------------------
Also data here on how many people saw people at their households/had people over in the past 7 days. A slight increase (to ~45%) over the past week vs. a week ago, but 45% is fairly typical over the long run. Also a slight decline in gathering at bars. https://t.co/BT47Wv58QC https://t.co/JHm6YWeTMN
-----------------------
@thehowie Yeah, the travel (although that *should* show up in the mobility data?) and the intergenerational mixing would seem like reasons for concern. In the other direction, I suspect some people who ordinarily are seeing people outside their household were being more careful than usual.
-----------------------
Why?

* Some people stayed home.
* Some businesses that are normally open were closed for the holiday.
* Many people see friends and family anyway during a typical weekâ€”so a Thanksgiving where some people see friends/family and some don't is not so different than the baseline.
-----------------------
Everybody is understandably concerned about COVID spikes caused by Thanksgiving but if you look at mobility data, there was really no increase vs. previous weeks; arguably a decrease depending on how you squint at the data, in fact. https://t.co/m1gOxoNtX2 https://t.co/OfC0D1YPXb

@CT_Bergstrom Like, I took some phone photos during a blackout in NYC last year where the colors were surreal and alien (not in an especially pretty way, either) and didn't at all resemble what you saw with the naked eye. It clearly didn't seem to know what to do under those conditions.
-----------------------
@CT_Bergstrom My lay understanding: I don't know about proper digital cameras, but I think a lot of phone cameras have algorithms that are designed to really draw out color to produce Instagram-worthy pictures, and they can go sort of haywire in low or unusual light.
