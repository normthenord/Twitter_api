SOLD OUT OF HAMILTON https://t.co/DnYvaw2oeP
-----------------------
@mattyglesias @BenjySarlin idk I think normie Dems also recognize that just getting Trump out of office is a hugely consequential event and that take has been significantly underweighted in the punditry about the election.
-----------------------
One thing I've noticed too is my real life Democratic friends are happy that Biden won and aren't obsessed with the question of how did Trump beat the point spread or got sorta-kinda-close. It's a more grounded perspective than you get on here or on the op-ed pages.

@HeerJeet I've never actually bet on a political betting market—my employer wouldn't like it and its unethical in various ways so I'm not sure how easy it is to get your money in/out. But in theory, yeah, it's free money.
-----------------------
@zeynep @TheStalwart @felixsalmon @MikeIsaac @pt Yeah, agree 100%.
-----------------------
@felixsalmon @TheStalwart @zeynep @MikeIsaac @pt No, I surely wouldn't. I wouldn't really give a shit because I don't think it's ethically problematic and it would probably wind up increasing traffic, etc to the story if we played our cards right.
-----------------------
@TheStalwart @felixsalmon @zeynep @MikeIsaac @pt Yeah I think this theory is pretty bizarre. Unless there's an explicit agreement to the contrary I think the subject of a story has every right in the world to preemptively react to the story.

@conorsen Lotta people clinging to bad takes from when it seemed like the pandemic was primarily an urban/high-density thing.
-----------------------
@MattGlassman312 Lots of parallels to other COVID related stuff, where opinion is highly polarized between American liberals and conservatives on questions that are often 1) very challenging and 2) don't neatly line up with American liberalism or conservatism in any obvious philosophical way.
-----------------------
Political betting markets still give Trump a &gt;10% chance, both nationally and in several states where *results have been certified*. As I've said before, it's a bit alarming there are so many delusional people out there that the market equilibrium is this detached from reality. https://t.co/SiKXccMvE8

https://t.co/nDHmjh0uCQ
-----------------------
Although, I think there are some arguments to be had about whether Trump actually gives a crap about Republicans winning in Georgia, or even wants them to win at all. Maybe if they lose he thinks it'll prove how important it is for Republicans to have him on the ballot.
-----------------------
Not that it's likely to swing that many votes, but in theory you'd think Trump would want to wait until after the Georgia runoffs to start the PardonFest.

Another way to look at this data: Tennessee is the 16th most populous state. So the 15 largest states in the US are either blue or purple.

-----------------------
The point is not necessarily that the theory is wrong, but that the idea that some types of people are less likely to answer polls—or to answer them honestly—isn't new, exactly. It's one of the eternal, fundamental challenges of polling.

The "shy Trump voter" theory ... used to explain why Republicans weren't answering exit polls in 2004. https://t.co/IqALG3SyFi
-----------------------
@mattyglesias So the point is not necessarily that there aren't better strategies than Trumpism, but that it's hard for a Republican to point toward any recent counterexamples and convince people that it will work, in a way that Democrats largely can do for Obamaism.
-----------------------
@mattyglesias Of course, you could interpret 2018 differently. Maybe it was mostly a backlash to attempts to repeal Obamacare. GOP turnout was quite high for a midterm, though so was Democratic turnout. They did save the Senate (and indeed gained seats).
-----------------------
@mattyglesias I think the problem is that we don't have a lot of examples of either way of how effective the first strategy is, electorally. The 2018 midterms featured a fair amount of "cultural" issues (i.e. the caravan) but Trump wasn't on the ballot and it didn't go well for the GOP.
-----------------------
@DKThomp Trumpism-has-a-high-floor is a part of the story for sure. If you overperform in white rural states, you're going to hold the Senate a large majority of the time, even if you usually lose the presidency and are up-and-down in the House.
-----------------------
@jbarro That's plausible for sure. Although if true in some ways a bearish read for the GOP in the short term, since in 2022 they'll probably still be seen as the party of Trump (largely unpopular with swing voters) without having the turnout boost that Trump provides.
-----------------------
The GOP has lost a lot of elections, after all: before Trump this year, Romney, McCain, Dole, Bush 41. Bush 43 won twice, but was unpopular enough by the end (resulting in bad GOP years in 2006 and 2008) that it probably isn't easy to sell as having been electorally successful.
-----------------------
It's the "mediocre at best" part that people will take to be provocative, I suppose. But it's the "not clear that the GOP's alternatives are better" part that may be more interesting: both the perception of it (does the GOP view moderation as a losing strategy?) and the reality.
-----------------------
Thesis that might be worth exploring:

Trumpism isn't a terribly effective electoral strategy—its track record is mediocre at best, even considering how much overperforming with noncollege whites helps with the Senate etc—but it's not clear that the GOP's alternatives are better.
-----------------------
This is a good read. Small household gatherings have always been a potential source of spread, but they haven't been a point of emphasis until recently. "Wait, now you can't even go over to friends/family's houses?" may be a hard message to sell vs. focusing on risk-reduction. https://t.co/9HWCqyVw1S
-----------------------
@BenjySarlin @chrislhayes Really? More than you expected from Loeffler, who embraced the endorsement of a QAnon promoter?
-----------------------
@BenjySarlin @chrislhayes 1) I don't know how far it got. Not only did they not breach the castle, I'm not sure they breached the moat.

2) This is debatable, obviously, but the fact that it was transparently ludicrous/doomed to fail could have been one reason that it didn't get more pushback.
-----------------------
@chrislhayes Obviously theories centered around GOP officials/functionaries were on much warmer ground than ones centered around the courts. If someone had one of those theories, congrats to them. If they had a court-driven theory, they probably need to re-evaluate their assumptions.
-----------------------
@chrislhayes OK, but "sure this could happen ... if the race is REALLY close" was always my position but got me yelled at by a bunch of people who thought that wasn't alarmist enough.
-----------------------
Trump has also gotten his ass handed to him in court decisions so far. So if your version of the story was "courts will steal the election for Trump", I think that requires a deeper re-examination of one's priors than other theories.
-----------------------
This is still the Underwear Gnomes problem. Under what pretext would ACB "thrown out ballots", enough to swing a not-super-duper-close election? To the extent we're talking about mail votes that arrived after Election Day, the impact of that is quite small FWIW. https://t.co/hZc9uzxj8q
-----------------------
Which was always an implausible plan that was extremely unlikely to succeed. To the extent that's the scenario people were banking on, it does look like an overreaction. There was never any explanation of the doctrine or pretext that courts would use to stop the count. https://t.co/1siCjfM19Z
-----------------------
Maybe that's OK. "We don't know *how* the election might be stolen, but Trump has expressed a lot of dangerous ideas and parts of the system haven't been tested, so we need to keep our guard up". That's totally reasonable. But there's a fine line between vigilance and panic.
-----------------------
Namely, there was a lack of precision to many of them; they didn't explain the mechanisms by which the election would be stolen. Often they were a bit Underwear Gnomes-ish:

1. Trump wants to steal the election
2. ???*
3. ELECTION STOLEN

* Or "THE COURTS!!"
-----------------------
It didn't come close to succeeding. But I don't think people should inherently be criticized for having pointed out that a high-impact but low-probability event—Trump stealing the election—deserved attention.

...

With that said, there were issues with *some* of these claims.

There's also a degree of path-dependance. If Facebook has lost high-info readers because its news feed is too low-quality, the remaining customers might not like it if you changed things. But ideally you'd want to win the high-info readers back, which could take time to measure.
-----------------------
Publishers understand this, which is why they employ editors. If the NYT wanted to maximize traffic *next week*, they could publish lots of highly sensationalist or even conspiratorial stories about Trump, etc. But this would likely be very damaging to them in the long term.
-----------------------
One thing that's striking here is the extent to which Facebook is maximizing for short-term, measurable gains as opposed to long-term brand equity. A better news feed could result in more trust from readers, more partnerships with news organizations, higher internal morale, etc. https://t.co/4ettG93YVw

Lukewarm take: It's fairly hard to infer how people would have behaved if the election were closer. (Close enough that Trump's efforts to overturn the result would stand a chance.) I mean we know how Trump would have behaved, but everyone else—courts, state officials, etc.

@BenjySarlin There's also an argument that outdoor things should have been more open in the summer so people could prepare themselves for having potentially much less social activity in the winter. Certainly less beach-shaming, etc.

@BenjySarlin I don't know. Europe has had very big problems in the fall too, obviously, despite better messaging and more stimulus. I don't think people widely understood that the warm-weather equilibrium of social activity wouldn't keep R&lt;=1 in colder water.

TBH it's kind of astonishing you think that I (an econ grad, btw) wouldn't know that. And part of an annoying pattern of academics underestimating the knowledge of non-academics.

@zeynep @davidshor @MattZeitlin @mattyglesias I mean it was certainly a weird column. The first half about the bubble was useful.

-----------------------
@zeynep @davidshor @MattZeitlin @mattyglesias I think people understand pretty well their social bubbles are not pristine. It's mostly a euphemism to say "everybody's being *pretty* careful here, right?". Or it's hygenie theater to defend the choice to see other people in person when you think you might get scolded for it.

FWIW my point here is not to make people feel particularly comfortable about the situation in NYC. The positive test rate has been (slowly) rising and my guess is it will rise further. But this shows the arbitrariness of the 3% threshold.

@davidshor @MattZeitlin @mattyglesias Also matters that transmission is relatively low in northern CA right now. Anyway, it shows how disconnected the Twitter bubble is from reality.

-----------------------
@MattZeitlin This is piggybacking off a @mattyglesias point but I think it shows the problem is that a lot of COVID behavior which may be rational from an individual's standpoint can nonetheless cause negative externalities for society.
-----------------------
@Neoavatara I'm not sure I'd take at face value the White House's claim that it was testing frequently.
-----------------------
Fauci is also a fan of frequent testing, at least as a theoretical concept. Tests need to be faster, more accurate &amp; more available. But the view that "tests just give people a false sense of security" has gone too far. They're a big part of the solution.

@NateDuncanNBA Yeah I'd hope that like "let's pay teachers way more" would be one of the legacies of this pandemic. Unfortunately, I think it might be the opposite with school budgets really suffering.
-----------------------
@jbarro Yeah, I think there's going to be a lot of overcompensation (not necessarily a bad thing). Plus stuff like people having a big 41st birthday party because their 40th fell during the pandemic.
-----------------------
I'm not sure that remote *learning* is going to have its reputation enhanced by this, though—probably the opposite. 

More voting by mail? I originally thought that would outlast the pandemic, but the way Trump/Republicans politicized it in the US, I don't know about that now.
-----------------------
I'm sure there will be some changes, but it seems like stuff that was overdue anyway. To take a trivial example, fast-food restaurants were always a natural fit for delivery and it's not surprising they upped their game. Less trivially, probably more tolerance for remote work.
-----------------------
Predictable, but many of these techno-utopian takes from early in the pandemic seem like they'll age poorly by having underestimated people's desire for in-person human contact. That's been hard to turn off, in ways that's made it hard to stop the spread. https://t.co/3dMqKe55I7 https://t.co/mWeXe3wcje

@MattGlassman312 Part of what I think makes it less complicated too is that this *precise* group of 4 senators have a lot of electoral immunity, to coin an expression. Murkowski's incentives changed a lot with the top 4 system that AK adopted. The other three possibly on their last term.
-----------------------
@MattGlassman312 l mean in some ways it might make sense for a Romney + Murkowksi + Collins + Manchin group to form *now*, because that way they have de facto control of the Senate regardless of who wins the Georgia runoffs.
-----------------------
I don't *quite* get Democrats' cynicism on Romney, Collins and Murkowski. They're Republicans! They're often going to vote for conservative stuff! But Murk/Collins voted with Trump only ~1/2 the time in the last Congress. And Romney voted to impeach Trump! https://t.co/hdJRgWVME7 https://t.co/qQVJCQqcUi
-----------------------
@AJentleson Right, yeah.
-----------------------
That doesn't mean he'd ever in a million years vote with the Democrats on, say, taxes. But on basic good-governance stuff—letting Biden appoint a cabinet, protecting against future elections from being stolen—he would.
-----------------------
Perhaps a bit far-fetched, but Romney actually has a decent amount of leverage, if he and one of Collins, Murkowski, etc. threatened to become "Independent Republicans" or what have you who caucused with the Democrats.
-----------------------
@Yair_Rosenberg And I think you're right that people sort of perpetuated some overly optimistic signals of what could be accomplished with a 4-8 week lockdown.
-----------------------
@Yair_Rosenberg Yeah. I mean, it was hard to be certain I guess—China seemed to do an OK job of containing it, and maybe it would prove to be super seasonal or something—but if you looked at the history of respiratory pandemics, "this is going to last a year+" was a reasonable expectation.
-----------------------
I was fairly pessimistic about COVID early on, but there was kind of this naiveté that I think I (and other people) had about timing. Like no one wanted to say "this could disrupt life for a year or longer" so anyone who said some version of that caught my attention.

@MileHighBrendan @chrislhayes Trump underperformed the fundamentals by 4-5 points, according to our analysis. And I think it's telling that Congressional Republicans, who had more distance from the anti-democratic tactics, outperformed Trump.
-----------------------
@chrislhayes It's not clear that it's 40-45% though. More like 50+% of Republicans but 25-30% of the overall electorate. And I'd argue that's a pretty relevant difference. https://t.co/IsVz4l88jp
-----------------------
@chrislhayes That seems to be the conventional wisdom, but I see no particular evidence behind it. I can imagine swing voters not liking this very much. I can also imagine it depressing GOP turnout. Or maybe not. But I think people are too quick to attribute strategic goals to it.
-----------------------

Trump is very savvy at constantly forcing fellow Republicans to choose between 1. doing his bidding and therefore remaining a Republican-in-good-standing in GOP circles or 2. acting according to normal democratic values, but losing Republican-in-good-standing status.
ID: 1329477116254183424
-----------------------
Revisiting this:

It's not as though Trumpism has been a particularly successful electoral strategy. But there's a degree of path-dependancy. If Republicans can win elections about half the time with it because of their structural advantages, they have less incentive to change. https://t.co/KupMfju2F0
-----------------------
I think these elites are also deluding themselves if they think that, if an election eventually does get stolen (very very likely not this one, but say 2024/2028/etc) that they'll be able to go back to the sort of cushy public life that they once enjoyed. It would be total chaos. https://t.co/RJoRxPaGdq
-----------------------
2) People need to get over their obsession with internal polls. They usually say the same thing as high-quality public polls. They usually don't tell you anything you don't know. To the extent they do, it may be a) spin or b) wrong.

https://t.co/tyIZ8cJb5p
-----------------------
Agree with this, and two additional points of context:

1) There's always the tendency to cast winning campaigns in the best possible light (and vice versa). FWIW, I do think Biden ran one of the better campaigns we've seen recently. But still, be wary of this halo effect. https://t.co/ZH9JFHpynr
-----------------------
@kmedved @MattZeitlin I think this dynamic was especially bad for COVID because coming up with a cohesive strategy sustainable over 12-18 months was always going to be incredibly difficult, so it was easier to just point toward Trump's (indeed mostly terrible/incoherent) approach and say "not that".
-----------------------
Basically it says Trump was wrong about lots of stuff and didn't actually make it any easier to open up schools, but nonetheless Trump's expressed support for school-openings made Democrats instinctively line up on the other side. That seems largely correct to me. https://t.co/TuafxAVML1

It's hard to strike the right balance between, on the one hand, pointing out how the erosion of democratic norms around accepting election results is highly concerning in the long run, and, on the other hand, pointing out how desperate and pathetic this all is.

Was projected to go higher so something good seemingly happened to the Knicks for a change but look forward to discovering how it turns out badly in the end. https://t.co/8YLEehBaRS
-----------------------
Also, I hate to touch off the "where is the herd immunity threshold?" debate but one datapoint worth mentioning here is that he estimates ND and SD have 35-40% of their populations infected and cases are still rising, though more slowly than before.
-----------------------
Really glad this is relaunching. And I like the emphasis on "nowcasting" rather than forecasting. It's been very hard to get reliable estimates of how many people truly have COVID at any given time (since not all cases are detected) and this is a big step forward. https://t.co/VzMy2ylMi5
-----------------------
@chrislhayes @LPDonovan Tossup based on how many ballots are left outstanding in NY, which nobody seems entirely sure of
-----------------------
I have receipts on what you did share and they did not match the 538 averages. https://t.co/ZJ0fqECum1
-----------------------
Also, the state's data still has 7-day average positivity in NYC at under 3% (more specifically, 2.5%). https://t.co/ajrjsiKyMv https://t.co/c5mLI28fke
-----------------------
Not looking to start an argument here, but at least in late October, Biden's internal polling—at least what they were sharing with reporters—was in fact very similar to the public polling.

https://t.co/5D8rO8W6ka https://t.co/6f4I4JLUkF
-----------------------
@bruce_arthur No but the increase is pretty modest. It's been at 2.5%ish for a while, slowly ticking upward.
-----------------------
@bruce_arthur You just can't learn that much from the positivity rate alone, though. If you have a positivity rate of 3% and it was 0.3% a week ago, that indicates exponential growth. If it was 3% and it was 6% a week ago, that indicates decline.
-----------------------
@bruce_arthur I don't buy either that a consensus of epidemiologists are saying that, or that it's robust analysis if they are. There are no magic inflection points here. And you'd measure growth by Rt, not the positivity rate.
-----------------------
It's not as though 3% is some tried-and-true, empirically- derived heuristic that's proven robust over many past pandemics. Everybody is just making this shit up as they go along! It's completely arbitrary.
-----------------------
I don't get why NYC feels bound to stick by a 3% positivity rule for closing schools when we know more about the virus now, including relatively low rates of transmission in schools. If I were a parent I'd be furious.

-----------------------
@kmedved I'm not super sure why expectations matter here but I also think that some of those forecasts misdiagnosed the macro conditions. Defending seats won in a D+9 environment (2018) presented a lot of downside risk for D's in an era of weak incumbency.
-----------------------
@Neoavatara Everyone would take the presidency + the House + maybe the Senate over state legislatures.
-----------------------
"Nobody owns those seats" is *especially* true in an era like now where there's a weak incumbency bonus, and it can make comparing results after a midterm and a presidential year pretty apples-to-oranges. Of note: Democrats gained a lot of seats relative to 2016 in the House.
-----------------------
I don't think "but they lost seats in the House!" is a great take because nobody owns those seats—everybody's term expired—and winning seats as the out-party at a midterm is a whole different (and much easier) ballgame than winning them in a presidential year.
-----------------------
@Neoavatara They won the House and the Senate is TBD.
-----------------------
Feels like everyone's running with their Why-Democrats-Lost takes even though Democrats won.

IDK, the headline here is that half of Republicans think the election was rigged but in some ways the fact that it's only half might suggest Trump's sore-loserism has a limited audience.

I don't have strong priors on what's going to happen in the Georgia runoffs but I do think some of people's macro conclusions about what the political environment looks like should probably wait until those are finished.

2/ That led us to speculate, "As a result of the immune response heterogeneity...it may be expected that at least a fraction of the SARS-CoV-2-infected population with particularly low immune memory would be susceptible to re-infection relatively quickly." https://t.co/5A8AIiUJmp

1/ This is a really good point @NateSilver538 , and I should reiterate it. We saw a lot of variation from person to person. We tried to visualize it this way.

@apoorva_nyc I know @florian_krammer is very clued in on this topic so that was my tip-off! Great job on the story, as always.
-----------------------
So that gives Democrats some leverage.
-----------------------
Who wins that? IDK, but in theory Murkowski could get squeezed out if say the Democrat gets 30% of the vote, the Libertarian gets 5% and the MAGA R gets 35%, leaving her with 30%.  Murkowski doesn't want there to be a strong Democratic nominee, in other words.
-----------------------
There are actually some pretty interesting incentives here. If you had to guess, you'd think a Top 4 general election in Alaska would consist of Murkowski, a Democrat, a MAGA/Tea Party Republican, and a Libertarian.
-----------------------
So basically, Murkowski can live without fear of a Republican primary challenge. https://t.co/s1sQB0sfMa
-----------------------
This section from their preprint is important. Immune responses vary, so for some small but unknown % of people reinfections will be possible on short time scales. But protection looks to be quite robust at 5-6 months out in ~90% of cases. https://t.co/uh3fQNNGck https://t.co/dfy1bnMCjS

Hey sometimes I'm pretty good at guessing! And this is indeed very good news, from a lot of experts that I've come to trust over the course of the pandemic.

Useful dashboard of which regions are having the most problems in New York State. Western NY has done very well throughout the pandemic but is up to 5% positivity now.

-----------------------
Even the Ohio batch should be pretty blue since what's left is late-arriving mail ballots, mostly from fairly blue counties.
-----------------------
I'm still tracking Biden's margin eventually getting up to 4.4 or 4.5 points. Apart from NY, there's not a *ton* left out there, but most of what's left should be pretty blue. Probably low-mid 6 figures worth of ballots to count in CA, IL, MA, MD, NJ, OH.
-----------------------
This is higher than earlier estimates of ~1.5 million and many of these votes are uncounted and they're going to be very blue, so should boost Biden's popular vote margin a bit. https://t.co/Pp4K4WRydc

2020-11-17 15:09:12
@NateSilver538 I may be too much of an optimist. But several simultaneously available vaccines that were pre-purchased makes me less concerned about supply. And focused, now, on demand.
ID: 1328716828475084801
-----------------------
One thing that's clearly been a problem, too, is polling in red states. In both 2018 and 2020, a lot of red-state Senate races that were projected to be close (e.g. TN, SC) just weren't.
-----------------------
This excludes a few races (GA, NH) where the Senate polling was pretty good, but even so, Congressional polls are going to miss more than those for the presidency, maybe around 5-6 points low on the GOP vs. 3-4 for POTUS. https://t.co/mhxHmt5Kpe
-----------------------
@davidshor I know you, specifically, have done a lot of work on response rates, have looked at microdata, etc., and may have had reason to think polls would underrate Trump. I don't think that case was strong based on publicly-available info, though.
-----------------------
@davidshor I'd find that more compelling if prediction markets hadn't been completely off their rocker in a pro-MAGA direction from election night onward. These aren't people who had deeply-researched, well-considered theories about polling bias.
-----------------------
For posterity's sake, I suppose the caveat to the above is that I can imagine cases being on the decline again by March/April or whenever the vaccine becomes widely available, which could create a messaging challenge.
-----------------------
I would be surprised if, at any point before say next September, there's an excess of vaccine because we can't find enough people willing to take it. (Maybe some oversupply at the local level, but I doubt nationally.) The challenge will be getting it in people's hands.
-----------------------
I suspect this increase in willingness to take vaccines is due to the increased spread of COVID—people looking for the light at the end of the tunnel. There will probably be a further increase as a result of i) the end of the election ii) positive vaccine trial results. https://t.co/WeNkknu7X2
-----------------------
@mattyglesias Yeah, there's definitely like some abstinence vs. safe sex parallels.
-----------------------
@mattyglesias I think it's very difficult. I guess my big meta-critique is that IMO the noneconomic costs of curtailing in-person social activity have been underrated. But it's becoming an easier problem with vaccines on the way (i.e. hunker down now and we'll "get it all back" soon enough).
-----------------------
@mattyglesias I think people have some poor heuristics, e.g. not adjusting enough for indoor vs. outdoor activity or for the incidence in their area at any given moment, but basically this is correct.
-----------------------
@poniewozik There is undoubtedly a lot of selection bias in who shares their how-I-got-corona stories.
-----------------------
Like maybe the vaccine is scaling Mt. Everest, and the distribution is getting down Mt. Everest, which is easier than scaling Mt. Everest but still pretty fricking arduous.
-----------------------
This seems like an off-kilter analogy to me given the unprecedented, mountainous accomplishment it has been to develop multiple apparently highly effective vaccines in 9 months. https://t.co/CmlpWMq5N1
-----------------------
The reason for this is that if you count in the other direction, i.e. go from Trump's best state to Trump's worst state, then WI only gets Trump to 269 so he'd need PA for 270. So I guess you could say WI is Biden's tipping-point state but PA is Trump's.
-----------------------
Actually it looks like PA will get Biden his 269th electoral vote (good enough for an Electoral College tie) and Wisconsin his 270th. When this happens, we consider there to be two tipping point states. So likely PA/WI get joint credit this year. https://t.co/qM59FWJlYY
-----------------------
@DanRosenheck @jipkin Also the fact that prediction market prices on Trump *right now* are *literally insane* might suggest that markets have no special sauce but just a pro-MAGA bias this cycle for whatever reason.
-----------------------
@apoorva_nyc @florian_krammer More evidence of fairly long lasting antibody and/or T-cell immunity?
-----------------------
There's this dumb argument circulating that if you'd known in advance what would happen—i.e. Trump beating his polls—you shouldn't have Biden e.g. a 90% chance of winning. Actually, if you'd known in advance what would happen, you should have given Biden a 100% chance of winning!
-----------------------
Collins winning re-election by 8 points while backing Trump only 45% of the time while Gardner lost re-election by 9 points while backing Trump 83% of the time would suggest that crossing partisan lines is still fairly popular with voters. https://t.co/hdJRgWVME7
-----------------------
@joshtpm I mean, it's only 60% non-Hispanic white, is very young, is decently college-educated. Would actually be an interesting place for D voter mobilization efforts.
-----------------------
It also looks like Alaska voters will probably approve an initiative implementing ranked choice voting + a nonpartisan primary where the top 4 candidates advance. Could give Murkowski more leeway to behave as a de facto independent.

https://t.co/vfntfRXrzf
-----------------------
Not surprising given the source but this tweet didn't age well. Trump's still gonna win Alaska but his margin is now down to 10 points as more votes have been counted. Biden has the highest share for a Democrat there since LBJ in 1964. https://t.co/WQvU7iNRur https://t.co/v84szXiNtz

1. Would have pushed for more targeted restrictions: encourage outdoor activity, reduce indoor stuff

2. Get more money to states to let them lead on testing, etc. 

3. Engage more bipartisan non-public-health leaders (religious, civil society) to augment public health messages https://t.co/BVpYJRHZz0

Question for public health people (and everyone). Suppose you'd known then what we'd know now about COVID and the governmental response to it. (Some stylized facts, which you're welcome to disagree with, suggested below.) What strategies would you have recommended back in March? https://t.co/AvnAjVNhHj
-----------------------
@chrislhayes @LPDonovan I dunno. I'd suggest that attempts at predicting long-term structural trends conducted in the first 30 days after an election have a fairly poor track record, e.g. the GOP autopsy after 2012 or the Permanent Republican Majority after 2004.
-----------------------
@chrislhayes @LPDonovan I think people are a little bit too confident about what the political effects will be and there may be a disconnect between hard-core Trumpers and more rank-and-file Republicans.
-----------------------
@BenjySarlin Well that's part of what I'm saying. If you have a whole cluster of 4-6 states around the tipping point, that probably tells you less going forward than if there is some exact combo that Democrats need for 270+.
-----------------------
There's a lot of attention on this platform to OAN or Newsmax overtaking Fox News as a go-to place for MAGA conservatives. But if you look at Google searches, while interest in these sources is up a bit, it's still far dwarfed by Fox News. https://t.co/0pDlfoMPkZ https://t.co/O6B28BkRXg
-----------------------
Simply because Biden has multiple paths and wasn't as dependent on the Midwest. He didn't need PA + WI to reach 270; GA and AZ (or NC, which wound up pretty close to the tipping point, too) would have sufficed.
-----------------------
Looks like the tipping-point state will be Wisconsin again, and it'll likely finish around 3.5 to 4 points more GOP than the country overall, which means there's an even bigger Electoral College gap than in 2016. With that said, I'd argue Biden's map is better than Clintons. Why?

@maciekboni I picked these because these are reasonable middle-ground estimates (you can certainly find some that are higher or lower). I read on these topics pretty widely. They reflect the expert consensus as far as I'm able to discern it.
-----------------------
@maciekboni The source for the 1 in 11 estimate (which was indeed derived from seroprevalence studies) is here: https://t.co/LHq22TePFR

And the source for the 1 in 3 estimate is here:
https://t.co/jbq7H44fyu
-----------------------
@thehowie Yeah, these estimates are trying to account for the number of tests a state was conducting per capita over the previous 14 days. But there's a lot of ambiguity, including on factors like # of tests conducted vs. # of people tested.
-----------------------
Even accounting for the fact that there was considerably more underdetection in the spring—when urban, coastal states were being hit harder—the pandemic really has turned out to be quite a bit worse in rural, conservative states.
-----------------------
Use with caution, but some quick-and-dirty estimates of the share of each state's population ever infected with COVID.

These assume—per various expert studies/estimates—that about 1 in 11 infections were detected in March through mid-May but that's improved to about 1 in 3 now. https://t.co/tc2RVcw7aR
-----------------------
@jbarro @conorsen I guess what I'm getting at is that there's a certain type of pro-Trump contrarianism from people in the finance orbit that I've observed both online and IRL. It may not be about supporting Trump per se but about having certain obnoxiously wrong views of the data, etc.
-----------------------
@jbarro @conorsen Fair enough. Also in New Canaan. But there could be an elite vs. rank-and-file divide.
